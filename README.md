## üëã Introducing ``fansly-dl``
**fansly-dl** is a fork from the original [Fansly Downloader](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly) repo with priminarly Linux users in mind.

This project aims to be an easy to use Fansly media downloader (Videos and Photos) from your favorite (and subriscribed) fansly creators. 

After you've launched the program, it'll create a sub-folder with the ``CreatorName`` in the directory you set in the parameter ``download_dir`` of the ``config.ini`` file. That folder will have two sub-folders called ``Pictures`` and ``Videos``, which will contain the downloaded content sorted into them.

This code **does not bypass any paywalls** & **no user information is ever collected.**

## üèóÔ∏è Set up

1. Clone this project repo:

	* ``$ cd fansly-dl``
3. Install the necessary Python packages: 
	* ``$ sudo apt install python3-tk``
	* ``$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure python3-tk``
	* ``$ pip install --user -r requirements.txt``
4. Get your Fansly.com account details to configure fansly-dl:
	* Make sure you have registered an account on fansly and are logged in with it in your browser, or you'll not be able to get an **authorization token** from Developer Console;
	* Go to whatever creator's account page and open your browsers developer console (Most often Key: F12);
	* Reload the website by using the rotating arrow symbol to the left of your browsers search bar(Key: F5), while the developer console is open. Now do the steps on the following picture:

	* Copy the string that is on the right side of `authorization:` then **replace** the text `YourAuthToken` (inside the ``config.ini`` file) with the value you just coppied;
	* Copy the string that is on the right side of `User-Agent:` then **replace** the text `YourUsrAgent` (inside the ``config.ini`` file) with latest coppied string.

After completing the configuration, you'll only need to change the creator name from `ReplaceWithCreator` in ``config.ini`` for every further use case on other creators.

## ü§î FAQ
Do you have any unanswered questions or want to know more about fansly scraper? Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/wiki)

+ **Q**: "Why do some executables show detections on them in VirusTotal?"
**A**: They are false positives (invalid detections). I literally e-mail each release of the scraper, for manual analysis to antivirus providers and the not üí© providers actually analyse and unflag them, while others don't even bother reading their e-mails, but for some reason managed to get on VirusTotals file scanning system.

+ **Q**: "Could you add X feature or do X change?"
**A**: Star the project and I'll think about it. Otherwise you could always [open a pull request](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/pulls)

+ **Q**: "I used the automatic configurator and my browser now displays insecure on fansly.com!"
**A**: That's a rare bug, caused by automatic configurator just press on the lock icon in the left side of your url bar, while being on fansly.com > click on cookies > remove & refresh the site and you're good

+ **Q**: "Will you add any payment bypassing features to fansly scraper?"
**A**: No, as the intention of this repository is not to harm fansly
